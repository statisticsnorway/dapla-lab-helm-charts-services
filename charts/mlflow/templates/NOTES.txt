*NOTES about deletion :*

- **You can safely delete this chart and recreate one later**
- Data volumes in the associated postgresql will not be deleted
- If you start a new {{ .Chart.Name }}, it will reuse this volume silently.
- If you want to delete this volume definitely : `kubectl delete pvc data-{{ .Values.postgresql.fullnameOverride }}-0`
