# dapla-lab-helm-charts-services

Helm charts for services meant to be run on Dapla Lab.

Dapla lab is our hosted version of [Onyxia](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia-api). Even though the helm charts are designed to work in the lab, they can also be used like regular helm charts.

This repo is strongly inspired by <https://github.com/InseeFrLab/helm-charts-interactive-services>

The helm charts are delivered via use of github pages (see gh-pages branch).

helm repo add dapla-lab-services <https://statisticsnorway.github.io/dapla-lab-helm-charts-services>

The repo is also browsable directly <https://statisticsnorway.github.io/dapla-lab-helm-charts-services/index.yaml>
